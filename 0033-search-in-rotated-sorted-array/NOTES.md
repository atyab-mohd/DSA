* This is quite a good problem in this problem to search an index of an integer first i'm finding the min integer present in an array so that i can break this rotated array into two sub-arrays. After which the problem will become quite easy i'm just using the binary search in that sub-array in which the integer lies as both of the sub arrays will be sorted and strickly increasing we can easily predict in which subarray the integer will lie after that just apply binary search on that subarray and rerturn the index
* **//TIME COMPLEXITY IS:- O(log n)**
